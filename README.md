# Find-that-nearest
Find that nearest shop (resturant, post office, news agent, supermarket etc)

Uses OpenCageData.com javascript api to pinpoint your location
Uses Google maps javascript api to search for, within that region.

To use properly you will need (free) api keys for both maps and data.

This version is designed to use in UK,
But probably can be hacked for use elsewhere.
